Welcome to your Rails project on Cloud9 IDE!

To get started, just do the following:

1. Run the project with the "Run Project" button in the menu bar on top of the IDE.
2. Preview your new app by clicking on the URL that appears in the Run panel below (https://best-app-kattak2k.c9users.io/).

Happy coding!

# Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## License

All source code in the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial.org/)
is available jointly under the MIT License and the Beerware License. See
[LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

 In Rails, this can be accomplished with rails destroy followed by the name of the generated element. In particular, these two commands cancel each other out:

```
$ rails generate controller StaticPages home help
$ rails destroy  controller StaticPages home help
```  
Similarly, in Chapter 6 we’ll generate a model as follows:
```
  $ rails generate model User name:string email:string
```
This can be undone using
```
  $ rails destroy model User
```  
(In this case, it turns out we can omit the other command-line arguments. When you get to Chapter 6, see if you can figure out why.)

Another technique related to models involves undoing migrations, which we saw briefly in Chapter 2 and will see much more of starting in Chapter 6. Migrations change the state of the database using the command
```
  $ rails db:migrate
```  
We can undo a single migration step using
```
  $ rails db:rollback
```  
To go all the way back to the beginning, we can use
```
  $ rails db:migrate VERSION=0
```  
As you might guess, substituting any other number for 0 migrates to that version number, where the version numbers come from listing the migrations sequentially.
